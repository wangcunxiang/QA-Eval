After leaving Hudson in 1743, Reynolds returned to Devon and began painting naval portraits at Plymouth Dock (now Devonport). In 1744, he returned to London for two years and began to acquire a knowledge of the old masters and an independent style marked by bold brushwork and the use of impasto.\nReynolds continued to develop his skills and reputation as a portrait painter throughout his life. In 1768, he was elected as the first president of the Royal Academy of Arts and was knighted by King George III. Reynolds died on February 23, 1792, at the age of 68 in London",

The name \"reticule\" came from the French r\u00e9ticule, which in turn came from the Latin reticulum, a diminutive of rete, or \"net\". Reticules were made in a variety of styles and shapes and sometimes trimmed with embroidery or beading. Women often made their own reticules.\n\nIn Victorian England, the reticule was becoming more commonplace among women who were no longer confined to the home. Up to this point, most women\u2019s fashions were void of any pockets in which to carry small belongings. The hanging pocket or reticule bag had been the one purse style that allowed middle and upper-class women to go shopping, traveling, visiting friends, and leaving calling cards with ease. It was carried in hand, shaped like the inside of a pocket. It held only a few critical items such as a handkerchief, fan, pencil, and cards. Victorian reticule bags (jokingly called indispensables in Britain) were decorated in patterns of roses, birds, buttercups, and daisies made of small beads or embroidered wool.

  "judge_gpt4": true,
  "answer_newbing": "Anemia can be caused by a deficiency of several dietary minerals. The most common type of anemia is iron-deficiency anemia, which is caused by a lack of iron in the body. Iron is an essential mineral that helps red blood cells carry oxygen to the body's tissues. When there is not enough iron, the body cannot produce enough hemoglobin, which is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. This can lead to anemia and its associated symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.\n\nIn addition to iron, other dietary minerals that can cause anemia if deficient include vitamin B-12 and folate (vitamin B-9). Vitamin B-12 is mainly found in animal products such as meat, eggs, and dairy, while folate is found in foods such as leafy green vegetables, fruits, and legumes. A deficiency in either of these vitamins can lead to a type of anemia called vitamin-deficiency anemia.\n\nIt's important to eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods rich in these essential nutrients to help prevent anemia. If you are concerned about your nutrient intake or have been diagnosed with anemia, it's a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider for advice on how to manage the condition. They may recommend dietary changes or supplements to help improve your nutrient levels.",

The hill myna, a common pet, is well known for its talking ability and its relative, the European starling, is also adept at mimicry.\n\nIt comes as a surprise to many that the tiny budgies, also known as budgerigars or simply as parakeets, can actually talk as well if not better than some of the larger parrot species.

The names of these two dishes are a bit of a culinary mystery, but we can see the obvious ways in which they differ.\n\n\u201cAngels on Horseback\u201d are older than its counterpart, originating in the 19th century, and are made by wrapping oysters in bacon, baking or frying them, and serving them on bread1. The name may stem from the fact that the curled edges of the pinned bacon resemble angel wings, and they\u2019re often served with lemon or lime juice1.\n\nLater in the culinary timeline, \u201cDevils on Horseback\u201d entered the scene, with a name perhaps inspired by the dish\u2019s red and black coloring1. This dish is made by taking pitted, large prunes (or sometimes dates) and wrapping them in bacon, much like the oysters in the \u201cangel\u201d recipe, and the prunes can even be stuffed with cheese or chutney1.\n\n",
